    I assist leaders and policy makers with finding the best choice when there are
    several outcomes possible. My experience in trade, transportation, science, and industry have
    given me the requisite tools useful to solve such situations as befall leadership.

    Critical thinking has become more valuable than knowledge. Experience comes with practice.
    Most expensive has become the unnecessary blunder.
